I followed James Huang's instructions [here](http://www.growthalytics.com/programming/2015/07/19/setting-up-your-own-blog).   Rather than cloning the newly created initial repo, when he says "download it straight into your empty GitHub repo," I first forked the Pixyll repo on GitHub, then cloned it to my machine, then gave it another remote `git remote add origin2 https://github.com/fcrimins/fcrimins.github.io`, then pushed to that remote,  and then set it as the default origin `git push -u origin2 master`.   Not sure if this is what he meant, but that's what I did!

Also thanks to John Otander for creating [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).

And of course thanks to the creators of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

And lets not forget GitHub for [hosting](https://pages.github.com/).
