I followed James Huang's instructions [here](http://www.growthalytics.com/programming/2015/07/19/setting-up-your-own-blog).  When he says "download it straight into your empty GitHub repo," I first forked the Pixyll repo on GitHub, and then I added it as a git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to the empty repo.  Not sure if this is what he meant, but that's what I did!  And then to start the server, I first cd'ed into the new `pixyll` submodule directory before running `jekyll serve`.

Also thanks to John Otander for creating [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).

And of course thanks to the creators of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
