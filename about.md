My name is Fred Crimins.  I'm Fred, and this is my blog.

I've kept most of these thoughts to myself in my gmail account for a long time, but I wanted somewhere more permanent to write them down.  I'm a little uneasy about making them all public, but what the heck.  Perhaps someone will find these and have something to contribute, and if nobody ever does, then that's fine too.
